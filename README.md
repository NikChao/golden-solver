# Golden Solver

A poker solver written in Java

### TODO:
* the algo gives us EXTREMELY innacurate results - generally OOP under-folds and IP way over-folds
* dedupe hands (don't let two players have the same hands)
* currently the solver doesn't take into account multiple streets or re-raises
* currently we don't support multi-way pots

### How to run and test
* **run:** `./gradlew run`
* **test:** `./gradlew test`
